THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN THE EARLY RESEARCH & DESIGN STAGES

## Intro

The Vicinity Alarm Clock (\/\\C) is a home alarm clock that only sounds when you're at home (or technically your phone).

## Description

\/\\C is something a bit unique in that I tend to stay a lot of other places and so I forget to turn off and on my home alarm clock. Needless to say, my neighbors are not happy with me, when I forget to turn it off. And I'm not happy, when I forget to turn it on. So, this would be a problem solved techology for me!

Furthermore, it will be a nice project for me to start home automations as well as get familiar with some new technologies such as bluetooth and maybe some display board stuff.

## Tech Stack

    • Rasberry Pi (IoT device)
    • Bluetooth (range network signal)
    • Python (Language)
    • Ubuntu (OS)
