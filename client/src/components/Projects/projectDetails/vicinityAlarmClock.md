## Intro

The Vicinity Alarm Clock is a home alarm clock that only sounds when you're at home (or technically your phone).

## Abstract

The Vicinity Alarm Clock is the autmation of turning your home alarm clock **`on`** and **`off`**, respectively, when you at home or not. For one, always have a back-up to your phone alarm, when you're at home. And two, perhaps more importantly, no more angry neighbors, when forgetting to turn your home alarm clock off (especially if your alarm is set for 5:30 AM).

Love thy neighbor... don't let this happen
