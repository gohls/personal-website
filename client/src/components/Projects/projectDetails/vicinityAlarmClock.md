## `THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN ITS EARLY RESEARCH & DESIGN STAGES - CHECK BACK SOON!`

## Intro

The Vicinity Alarm Clock is a home alarm clock that only sounds when you're at home - well, technically when your phone is at home.

## Abstract

The Vicinity Alarm Clock is the autmation of turning your home alarm clock **`on`** and **`off`**, respectively, when you're at home or not. For one, it always guarantees a back-up to your phone alarm, when you're at home. And two, perhaps more importantly, no more angry neighbors, when forgetting to turn off your home alarm clock (especially if your alarm is set for 5:30 AM).

## Tech

I anticipate technologies and hardware of this project to include:

• Raspberry Pi (IoT device)  
• Matrix-Panel (Display board)  
• Bluetooth
