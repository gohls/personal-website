## Promotion

We are not talking about the outdoor game. This Capture the Flag (CTF) is a competition in computer science. More specifically, CTF events involve solving challenges such as in programming, cryptography, web, recon, and many more. Solving a challenge == capturing a flag. Flags == points. The team with the most points in the end wins or the team that solves all challenges first - unlikely MUAHAHHA >:)

## Challenges

Bash • Crypto • Forensics • Misc • Networking • Trivia • Web • Whiteboard

### Example: crypto1
