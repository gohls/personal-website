## Intro

This web app aims at deeper self-awareness, via data collection, statistical caluculations, and data-vizualization.

## Abstract

When we think of self-awareness, we tend to think of how we are doing in the present moment, or maybe about some big moments in our personal history, but there is often a more subtle side of our being, that—if we don’t give conscious attention to—can get overlooked. Over time, small habits can have a large impact. DataTrace allows users to define an area that they want to track over time—for example, exercise—and to assess progress via an intuitive 1-10 scale. Each assessment is saved (with the ability to comment), so that a user can visit them later for insights on their progress. In short, DataTrace aims to help users connect the dots of their habits and to trace a better future.
