## Intro

A web-app aimed at deeper self-awareness via data collection, statistical caluculations, and data-vizualization.

## Abstract

What is self-awareness? Is it a reflection of the present moment, important moments in our past, or of our future goals? Arguably, it is a combination of all three. If we’re not careful, though, the inertia of everyday life can cause us to lose sight of ourselves. Over time, small habits can generate a large impact. The main goal of DataTrace is to promote awareness and assessment of these ‘life categories’ or habits. Using a mix of javascript technologies like MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, and NodeJS, DataTrace empowers the user to identify life categories they would like to track. Similar to a journal, these categories can be assessed and viewed over-time--allowing a user to extract insights. In short, DataTrace aims to help users connect the dots of their habits and trace a better future.

## Tech Stack

• MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Nginx)  
• DigitalOcean droplet  
• Docker - Containerization
