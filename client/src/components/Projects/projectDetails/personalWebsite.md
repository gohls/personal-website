## Intro

My personal portfolio website made to highlight **`me`** and my qualifications, while also highlighting my programming skills through the development itself.

## Development Cycles

This website has been under developement for quite some time, but it could've been done a long time ago. My "inner critic", or as "customer" of my own page, I keep scope creeping ideas into it. However, I would say it's at about 90% done, so I'm official announcing the release of `simongohl.me`!

## Learning of Technologies (LoT)

As part of building my website, I want to learn new techologies. So as mentioned, the ~/ðŸ¥¼ directory will serve as my playground to test out things. As of right now, I do not have anything... but one of the first things I plan on experimenting with is blockchain algorithms - maybe a blockchain bulletin board?!

## Tech

Technologies involved in my website include:

React â€¢ Express â€¢ Docker containers â€¢ DigitalOcean droplet â€¢ Nginx

(Backend implementation pending)
