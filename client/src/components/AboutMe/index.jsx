After 5 fulfilling but challenging years in that field, I decided it was time for a change. I made the difficult and risky choice to go back to school full time in a field I had long had interest in - Computer Science."

    const less3 = "Now, I am focusing my efforts on doing all things Computer Science including software development projects, participation in hackathons and capture the flag challenges (CTF), and attending coding and cybersecurity events. When I'm not studying or doing the aforementioned extra curricular activities, I also enjoy working out, taking walks, trying new foods and watching Netflix."

    const more1 = "While I enjoy most things coding, a particularly interest of mine is in the field of cyber security. Part of the reason is definitely the challenge - and all the headbanging >:] However, it's also about understanding what's happening behind the curtains of code, so to speak. Assembly language and reverse engineering do just that for me."
